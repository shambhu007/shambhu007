Artificial Intelligence

Meaning of the word: ‘Intelligence’  
•	The ability to reason   
•	The ability to understand   
•	The ability to create   
•	The ability to learn from past experience   
•	The ability to plan and execute complex task  

Based on the above definition of intelligence, `artificial intelligence' is the branch of the science and engineering necessary to create artifacts that can  
•	Acquire knowledge, i.e., can learn and extract knowledge; and   
•	Reason with knowledge (leading to doing tasks such as planning, explaining, diagnosing, acting rationally, etc.),  
•	It is the branch of science concerned with making computers behave like humans.  

•	AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs	    			
According to Barr and Feigenbaum, “Artificial Intelligence is the part of computer science concerned with designing intelligence computer systems, that is, systems that exhibit the characteristics we associate with intelligence in human behavior.”  
According to Elaine Rich, “AI is the study of how to make computers do things at which, at the moment, people are better”.

AI Perspectives:
 Acting and thinking humanly, acting and thinking rationally 
Thinking Humanly: The cognitive modelling approach  
•	If we are going to say that a given program thinks like a human, we must have some way of determining how human thinks.  
•	We need to get inside the actual working of human minds.  
•	Two ways of doing this is:  
•	Predicting and testing human behavior (cognitive science)  
•	Identification of neurological data (cognitive neuro science)     
•	If the program’s input/output and timing behavior matches human behavior, that is evidence that some of the program’s mechanisms may also be operating in humans.  
•	Activities that we associate with human thinking are decision-making, problem solving, learning, etc.   
 
 Acting Humanly: The Turing Test Approach  
•	The Turing test is a method for determining whether or not a computer is capable of thinking like a human.   
•	The test is named after Alan Turing, an English mathematician who pioneered artificial intelligence during the 1940s and 1950s, and who is credited with devising the original version of test.   
•	According to this kind of test, a computer is deemed to have artificial intelligence if it can mimic human responses under specific conditions.  

Thinking Rationally: The “laws of thought approach”  
•	Undeniable reasoning process    
•	The study of mental faculties through the use of computational models.    
•	The study of computations that make it possible to perceive, reason and act.      
•	The Greek philosopher Aristotle was one of the first to attempt to codify “right thinking”    
•	His famous syllogisms provided patterns for argument structures that always gave correct conclusions given correct premises.    
•	For example, “Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal.” These laws of thought were supposed to govern the operation of the mind, and initiated the field of logic.
   
Acting Rationally: The rational agent approach  
•	Acting rationally means acting so as to achieve one’s goals, given one’s beliefs.  
•	An agent is just something that perceives and acts.  
•	In this approach, AI is viewed as the study and construction of rational agents.   

Brief History of AI
Here’s a brief timeline of the past six decades of how AI evolved from its inception.
1956 - John McCarthy coined the term ‘artificial intelligence’ and had the first AI conference.
1969 - Shakey was the first general-purpose mobile robot built. It is now able to do things with a purpose vs. just a list of instructions.
1997 - Supercomputer ‘Deep Blue’ was designed, and it defeated the world champion chess player in a match. It was a massive milestone by IBM to create this large computer.
2002 - The first commercially successful robotic vacuum cleaner was created. 
2005 - 2019 - Today, we have speech recognition, robotic process automation (RPA), a dancing robot, smart homes, and other innovations make their debut.
2020 - Baidu releases the LinearFold AI algorithm to medical and scientific and medical teams developing a vaccine during the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic. The algorithm can predict the RNA sequence of the virus in only 27 seconds, which is 120 times faster than other methods. 

Foundation of Artificial Intelligence
The disciplines that contributed ideas, viewpoints, and techniques to AI. It is forced to concentrate on a small number of people, events, and ideas and to ignore others that also were important. I’ll explain and represent it through a series of questions
1.	Philosophy  
• Can formal rules be used to draw valid conclusions?  
• How does the mind arise from a physical brain?  
• Where does knowledge come from?  
• How does knowledge lead to action?    
✒️ Rationalism, Dualism, Materialism, Empiricism, Induction, Logical Positivism, Confirmation Theory.
2.	 Mathematics    
•	What are the formal rules to draw valid conclusions?  
•	What can be computed?  
•	How do we reason with uncertain information?  
The main three fundamental areas are logic, computation and probability.  
✒️ Algorithm, incompleteness theorem, computable, tractability, NP completeness, Non deterministic polynomial and probability.
3.	 Economics    
•	How should we make decisions so as to maximize payoff?  
•	How should we do this when others may not go along?  
•	How should we do this when the payoff may be far in the future?      
✒️ Utility, Decision Theory, Game Theory, Operations Research.    
4.	 Neuroscience  
How do brains process information?
Neuroscience is the study of the nervous system, especially the brain. We are still a long way from understanding how cognitive processes actually work. The truly amazing conclusion is that a collection of simple cells can lead to thought, action, and consciousness or, brains cause minds. The only real alternative theory is mysticism: that minds operate in some mystical realm that is beyond physical science.

5.	Psychology  
How do humans and animals think and act?  
✒️ Behaviorism, Cognitive psychology.
The three key steps of a knowledge-based agent:  
I. the stimulus must be translated into an internal representation  
II. the representation is manipulated by cognitive processes to derive internal representations  
III. These are in turn retranslated back into action.  

6.	 Computer Engineering  
How can we build an efficient computer?  
✒️ Operational computer and operational programmable computer  
AI has pioneered many ideas that have made their way back to mainstream computer science, including time sharing, interactive interpreters, personal computers with windows and mice, rapid development environments, the linked list data type, automatic storage management, and key concepts of symbolic, functional, declarative, and object-oriented programming.

7.	Linguistics  
How does language relate to thought?
Verbal Behavior — behaviorist approach to language learning  
✒️ Computational linguistics or natural language processing and knowledge representation.

8.	Control theory and cybernetics  
How can artifacts operate under their own control?  
control Theory, Homeostatic and objective function.

Application of AI

•	Artificial intelligence has been used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, stock trading, robot control, law, remote sensing, scientific discovery and toys.  
•	Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry.    
•	In the late 90s and early 21st century, AI technology became widely used as elements of larger systems, but the field is rarely credited for these successes.  

1. Game Playing  
•	Machines can play master level chess. There is some AI in them, but they play well against people mainly through brute force method, looking at hundreds of thousands of positions.
2. Speech Recognition  
•	It is possible to instruct some computers using speech. In 1990s, computer speech recognition reached a practical level for limited purposes.
3. Understanding Natural Language  
	To perform many natural language processing tasks such as machine translation, summarization, information extraction, word sense disambiguation need the AI in machine.
4. Computer Vision  
	Computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial system that extract information from images. The image data can take many forms such as videos sequences views from multiple cameras and data from a medical scanner.
5. Expert System  
	Expert system needs the AI to perform its task. One of the first expert system was MYCIN in 1974 which diagnosis bacterial infections of the blood and suggests treatments.
6. Finance  
	Financial institutions have long used artificial neural network systems to detect charges or claims outside of the norm, flagging these for human investigation.  
	Use of AI in banking can be traced back to 1987 when Security Pacific National Bank in USA set-up a Fraud Prevention Task force to counter the unauthorized use of debit cards.
7. Hospitals and medicine  
	Artificial neural networks are used as clinical decision support systems for medical diagnosis, such as in Concept Processing technology.    
	Other tasks in medicine that can potentially be performed by artificial intelligence include:

10. Identification Technologies  
• ID cards  
	 e.g., ATM cards
	 can be a nuisance and security risk:
	cards can be lost, stolen, passwords forgotten, etc.  
• Biometric Identification  
	 walk up to a locked door
	camera
	fingerprint device
	microphone
	 computer uses your biometric signature for identification face, eyes, fingerprints, voice pattern
